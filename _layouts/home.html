  My name is Adrien. My interests lie in the field of sociotechnical transitions. 
  Particularly, in the ways the tools of complexity science and system thinking can 
  contribute to the emergence of a regenerative and resilient society. And in doing so,
  expand the frontiers of knowledge in the fields of collective and hybrid intelligence.
