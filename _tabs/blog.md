My blog is a **[digital garden](https://adrien-perello.github.io/notes/)**, not a blog.

"Digital gardens" (also called "second brains") are similar to personal wikis. They focus on facilitating **network thoughts** by the use of **bi-directional links**. Those connection in turn creates a trail of ideas that readers can follow. They move away from blogs and their chronologically sorted pages of polished articles. Instead, they are **collection of evolving ideas** that grow and evolve over time. They are inherently exploratory. They supports and encourages **bridging and pollination of ideas** to further understanding, and for this reason the emphasis is on the process, care, and craft it takes to cultivate such a garden.

They are inspired by the [Zettelkasten method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) (made famous in part by the sociologist Niklas Luhmann), and are gaining momentum with the use of wikis and [knowledge graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph) as well as with the surge of digital tools such as [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/), [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) or [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/). You can find more resource on the topic [here](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners).
