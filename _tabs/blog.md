[My blog](https://adrien-perello.github.io/notes/) is a **digital garden**, not a blog.

"Digital gardens" (also called "second brains") are similar to personal wikis. They support creative knowledge work by facilitating **networked thinking** (in particularly with the use of of **bi-directional links**). They are a space to collect and connect the dots. Those connections in turn create trails of ideas that readers can follow. Digital gardens move away from blogs and their chronologically sorted pages of polished articles. Instead, they are **collections of interconnected ideas** that grow and evolve. They are inherently exploratory. They supports and encourages **bridging and pollination of ideas** to further understanding, and for this reason the emphasis is on the process of improving and nurturing them over time. In a word, gardening them.

They are inspired by the [Zettelkasten method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) (made famous in part by the sociologist Niklas Luhmann), and are gaining momentum with the use of wikis and [knowledge graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph) as well as with the surge of digital tools such as [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/), [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) or [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/). You can find more resource on the topic [here](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners).
