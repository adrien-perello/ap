### About me

From an early age, I have been absorbed by existential questions. My reflections on societal narratives have inspired a decade long of traveling across all continents. If my pilgrimage was motivated by a deep curiosity, it was also - I must say - an attempt at grasping the essence of our existence and forging a purpose in life. 


### My vision

Of central importance to the understanding I developed along the years is the human need for meaning that emerges from the consciousness of our own finitude. As well as the dialectics between our personal story and the collective narratives that aim at addressing this human inquiry. Collective narratives whose arbitrary and ever-changing nature is concealed by culture and social norms and whose foundations are being shaken - more than ever since the scientific revolution - by the [multiple converging crises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_boundaries) Humanity is facing.
